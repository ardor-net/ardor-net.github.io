ARDOR-NET: Academic Researchers Developing Open Robotics Network
================================================================

How to better utilize open systems developed by roboticists in academia.

## Introduction

Open source robotics software has classically suffered from a lack of appropriate maintenance and is either short-lived, poorly documented, not advertised, or some combination of the above. Between 2007 and 2013, Willow Garage broke these trends and unified the efforts of many actors in the open source robotics communities. The key to this was the coordination of the Willow Garage Intern Program. This program not only brought rising robotics researchers to Willow, then a center of cutting-edge robotics research, but also created a network of ROS users and developers who could talk about and collaborate on various robotics software.

The Academic Researchers Developing Open Robotics(ARDOR) Network and its constituent ARDOR Groups aim to resurrect this network of student developers and provide a framework for collaborating on open robotics systems.

## The ARDOR Network

The Academic Researchers Developing Open Robotics (ARDOR) network creates a framework for sustainable open source robotics development through handfuls of proactive students at numerous academic institutions.

The physical infrastructure for the ARDOR Network Is fairly lightweight. It includes a mailing list for all ARDOR members, and a simple online registry which lists software maintained by each ARDOR group.

The goals of the ARDOR Network primarily include the following:

* Create a community of developers which is robust to the inherent short life of a PhD student;
* Create stronger connections between research groups at disparate institutions;
* Create a community of vetted developers who can be trusted to write quality code;
* Improve, unify, and standardize the numerous open-source systems on which we depend when conducting robotics research.

This network is composed of ARDOR Groups at independent research labs and academic institutions. These groups are given a handful of easily-managed responsibilities which will strengthen and improve the open robotics research community.

## ARDOR Group Anatomy

An ARDOR group is composed of at least one student researcher at an academic institution. They are officially recognized once they are listed on the main ARDOR site.

ARDOR groups must have students who satisfy following officer roles (the assignment of roles is the responsibility of the individual groups):

* President
* Treasurer
* Triage Coordinator
* Maintenance Coordinator

Additionally, there can be many other "participating members" of a group outside of the officer roles. However, only the officers need to be listed and kept up to date.

### President

The president is responsible for making sure the ARDOR group does not evaporate.

### Treasurer

An ARDOR group treasurer is responsible for managing the group's funds. These are funds which may be gathered either through direct funding from the group's home institution, from grants, or from donations by other groups, individuals, or organizations.

It is possible that individuals and/or corporate entities may want to sponsor one or more ARDOR groups. These funds can be used as the ARDOR group sees fit.

### Triage Coordinator

The Triage Coordinator is responsible for responding to any tickets or issues reported on actively maintained software. These responses must happen in a timely manner, and a ticket should not go untriaged for more than a week, or else it will affect the ARDOR group's reputation.

Responses do not necessarily need to sufficiently answer the question, or fix the bug, but they should appropriately label the bug with standard ARDOR issue labels and make a best effort to either find someone to solve the issue or explicitly close it. 

The triage coordinator has one of the most important roles in an ARDOR group, since it involves communicating with potential collaborators.

### Maintenance Coordinator

The Maintenance Coordinator is responsible for keeping the list of maintained code up to date. When a component is no longer going to be maintained due to a research shift or graduation, it is the maintenance coordinator's responsibility to make a best effort to find someone to take over maintainership of the package.

This includes not only asking users at the ARDOR group's home institution, but also teaching out to others in the ARDOR network.

## ARDOR Activities

Members of the ARDOR network are encouraged to reach out to others in the community, and help get open-source contributions reviewed and merged.

## Benefits to The Academic Robotics Community

While research code is generally very platform and application-specific, there are thousands of low- and mid-level frameworks which are used across many robotics applications. Currently, if a student finds a bug in one of these frameworks, it is sometimes reported to the maintainer of the given package. If the maintainer does not respond, it is often the case that the student will at least try to patch a local version of the package. These fixes end up going unnoticed without a system which can make these modifications more visible. 

Students involved in an ARDOR group at a given institution will also benefit from having a formal system through which they can publish code along with their scientific publications. This not only gives them greater exposure, but enables a deeper level of peer review of the implementation of scientific contributions. The ARDOR Network will encourage students to publish code along with their scientific results, which will add credibility to their academic publications. 

The ARDOR Network is structured so that it can improve the open robotics community as a whole, but it also has direct benefits to students who participate. The connections that students make will help them both collaborate on research projects and develop their identity in the community. It will also create a pool of students who can help each-other out with various robotics infrastructure and implementation issues.

## ARDOR Network Infrastructure

Besides the main site and mailing list, the ARDOR Network is a completely federated network. The main index website are hosted on GitHub, and will manage modifications both to the website and to the lists of active packages via GitHub Pull Requests.

* The main site can be found at: [http://ardor-net.github.io/](http://ardor-net.github.io/)
* The mailing list can be found at: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ardor-net](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ardor-net)

## FAQ

### Are ARDOR groups only for ROS-based code?

*No! While ROS has become one of the largest platforms for open-source robotics research, the ARDOR network aims to unify more efforts than just those in the ROS community.*

### Does it cost anything to create and maintain an ARDOR group?

*No! To create an ARDOR group, you simply need to declare yourselves one, and start participating.*

### Is the ARDOR Network associated with OSRF?

*No, ARDOR has started as a "grassroots" organization of academic robotics researchers, and is not formally associated with OSRF.*

### What does "Open" refer to in “ARDOR”?

*In this case, it describes both the open nature of the community as well as the open-source designation of the code listed in the ARDOR Network and maintained by ARDOR Groups. We consider code to be "open-source" if it is licensed under an accepted open-source license listed here: http://opensource.org/licenses*
